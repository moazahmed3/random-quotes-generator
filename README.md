📚 Random Quote Generator
A clean and interactive mini JavaScript project that generates random quotes from a public API with optional automation and a touch of animation.

🚀 Tech Stack
HTML5 – for structure

CSS3 – for styling and animations

JavaScript (ES6) – for logic and DOM manipulation

API Used: dummyjson.com/quotes

🎯 Project Features
✅ Generate Quote: Display a random quote on button click

🔁 Auto Mode: Automatically generate a new quote every 2 seconds

🛑 Stop Mode: Stop the auto-generation process

🆔 Each quote comes with an ID, text, and author

🎨 Basic animation on the quote text when it changes

📦 How It Works
On first load, quotes are fetched once and stored locally in an array.

When clicking "Generate", a random quote is selected and displayed.

Clicking "Auto" starts a 2-second interval that updates quotes automatically.

"Stop" clears the interval and halts the quote generation.

💡 Lessons & Concepts Applied
Fetching data using fetch() and handling JSON

Using async/await for asynchronous flow

DOM manipulation (querySelector, innerHTML)

Interval control with setInterval and clearInterval

Basic CSS animation triggered on content change
